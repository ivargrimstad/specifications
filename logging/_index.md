Jakarta Logging defines a standard API for logging within Jakarta EE applications. It provides a unified and modern approach to handling log messages across frameworks and libraries in the Java ecosystem.

It eliminates the need for competing logging APIs, complex configurations, and bridgesâ€”improving maintainability and security.

Jakarta Logging offers a vendor-neutral API inspired by established logging frameworks. It focuses on ease of use, clear semantics, and a developer-friendly design.

Jakarta Logging does not provide a logging implementation but ensures developers and framework authors have a reliable, consistent API to work with.
